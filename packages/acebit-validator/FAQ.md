### Is registering for a PREMINT list safe?
Yes. Over 1 million list registrations have happened on PREMINT without issue. When you sign in with PREMINT, you only are validating ownership of the wallet address. PREMINT does not get any permissions to perform transactions, and does not have any way of withdrawing anything from your wallet.


### Why does PREMINT ask permission to “suggest transactions to approve” when logging in with MetaMask?
MetaMask’s standard text for anyone connecting their wallet (as of 3/2022) is “See address, account balance, activity, and suggest transactions to approve.” We don’t have any control over that and you’ll see that message when signing into any site with MetaMask.

### Why do I need to “Sign” a message in addition to connecting my wallet.
Signing is the only way we can truly know that you are the owner of the wallet you are connecting. Signing is a safe, gas-less transaction that does not in any way give PREMINT permission to perform any transactions with your wallet.
